# VoiceCalculator
A calculator with simple functions that works with your voice.
It runs on Python.
The required dependancies are SpeechRecognition and wordtodigits.
I have only a little bit of knowledge about python so I learned how to make this on StackOverflow.
I made this as a project for a science expo being held at my school. It managed to win us a second prize.
Even if this is the simplest piece of code ever, I am gonna put it in here as a memory of my endeavour.
It has basic functions of addition, subtraction, multipication and division.
An internet connection is required as it uses google's speech engine, which may comically blurt out errors on occasion.
Be in a quiet place, or have a good mic with noise cancellation (google will not appreciate noise). Reducing mic sensitivity could help.
Enjoy using this.
