# VoiceCalculator
A calculator with basic functions that works with your voice.
It runs on Python.

Dependencies - SpeechRecognition, wordtodigits.
They can be installed using the pip addon of Python. Instructions on how to do that are available online.

An internet connection is required as it uses google's speech engine, which may comically blurt out errors on occasion.
Be in a quiet place, or have a good mic with noise cancellation (google will not appreciate noise). Reducing mic sensitivity could help.
Enjoy using this.
