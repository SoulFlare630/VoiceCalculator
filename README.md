# VoiceCalculator
A calculator with simple functions that works with your voice.
It runs on Python.
The required dependancies are SpeechRecognition, wordtodigits and optionally, pyttsx3, even though it is unused.
I made this as a project for a science expo being held at my school. It managed to win in the IT category.
Even if this is the simplest piece of code ever, I am gonna put it in here to make people remember it forever.
It has basic functions of addition, subtraction, multipication and division.
An internet connection is required as it uses google's speech engine, which may comically blurt out errors on occasion.
Be in a quiet place or have a good mic with noise cancellation (google will not appreciate noise).
Enjoy using this.
