# VoiceCalculator
A calculator with basic functions that works with your voice.
It runs on Python.
Dependancies - SpeechRecognition, wordtodigits
An internet connection is required as it uses google's speech engine, which may comically blurt out errors on occasion.
Be in a quiet place, or have a good mic with noise cancellation (google will not appreciate noise). Reducing mic sensitivity could help.
Enjoy using this.
